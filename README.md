Thanks for sharing the GitHub repository info. Based on the README and assignment brief from the CSS3 Transitions, Animations, and Advanced JavaScript Functions module, here’s a quick summary of what’s expected of you:


---

Assignment Goals:

1. Create CSS animations and transitions
– Animate elements like buttons, images, etc.


2. Write JavaScript functions
– Use functions to add interactivity. – Store and retrieve data using localStorage.


3. Trigger animations with JavaScript
– Example: animate something when a button is clicked.




---

Example Implementation Plan:

CSS (animation):

@keyframes fadeIn {
  from { opacity: 0; }
  to { opacity: 1; }
}

.fade {
  animation: fadeIn 2s ease-in;
}

JavaScript (localStorage + animation trigger):

function savePreference(key, value) {
  localStorage.setItem(key, value);
}

function loadPreference(key) {
  return localStorage.getItem(key);
}

document.querySelector("#animateBtn").addEventListener("click", () => {
  document.querySelector("#box").classList.add("fade");
});

Would you like me to help you build a full example or troubleshoot your current code?
