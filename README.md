Thanks for sharing the details of your GitHub Classroom project. Based on the assignment for the CSS3 Transitions, Animations, and JavaScript Functions module, here's a breakdown of what youâ€™re expected to implement:


---

Assignment Objectives:

1. CSS Transitions & Animations

Use @keyframes and CSS classes to animate elements like buttons, images, and divs.

Add transitions to hover or state changes (e.g., button hover).



2. JavaScript Functions

Create interactive functions (e.g., toggling themes, saving settings).

Use localStorage to store and retrieve user preferences or states.



3. JavaScript-Triggered Animations

Use JS to dynamically add CSS classes that trigger animations.

Example: Clicking a button makes a div fade in.

Sample Code Snippet:

HTML:

<button id="animateBtn">Animate Box</button>
<div id="box" class="box"></div>

CSS:

.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: coral;
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 2s ease-in;
}

.fade {
  opacity: 1;
}

JavaScript:

document.getElementById("animateBtn").addEventListener("click", () => {
  document.getElementById("box").classList.add("fade");
});

localStorage Example:

function savePreference(key, value) {
  localStorage.setItem(key, value);
}

function loadPreference(key) {
  return localStorage.getItem(key);
}

// Example usage:
savePreference("theme", "dark");
console.log(loadPreference("theme")); // outputs: dark
